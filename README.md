# The Game
`Quick, Guess!` is a word/phrase guessing game (commonly known as *hangman*). This game currently supports up to two players and is under development.
## Our Goal
With this game, we hope to be able to provide a resource that may help kids learn **new vocabulary** and get a **deeper understanding** of words in a **fun** and **engaging** way.
## Quick Overview
As of right now, two players are able to play competitively in this word guessing game. Each player takes turns  guessing the words while making sure not to lose any lives. Last one standing wins the game!
### How to Win
Since this is a competitive game which people tend to enjoy, it's necessary to know how to crush your opponent! Each player has _3 lives_ (will change in upcoming gamemodes) and may lose a life if the word is not guessed before the timer runs out or if they guess too many incorrect letters. Be the one with lives at the end, to claim your victory!
### Abilities (Under Development)
To add more *spice* to the game, there are more comlpications and things you can do. One such thing would be perks, which may be gained randomly after surviving a round without losing any lives. These perks could either be used for personal benefit or sabotaging your opponent by doing the following:
- Gaining more time
- Gaining more incorrect guess chances
- Decreasing your opponent's time
- Lowering incorrect guess chances for your opponent
More abilities will be on their way!
